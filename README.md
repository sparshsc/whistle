# whistle
A mobile app made with Swift created and intended for college students’ campus safety.
Student safety in college campuses is a big concern. To address this I created a mobile app Whistle that I plan to share with SCU campus security staff. It uses MapKit and CoreLocation Services provided by iOS to create a 3D map that provides users with safe walking/biking directions to selected destination with ability to scan the area for public/known locations AKA safe spots. In case of emergency, they can press a silent SOS button in the app that sends a message to user’s chosen emergency contacts in 30 sec intervals with distress message and location. The app uses UserDefaults Foundation to store all the user personal information locally in the device. This includes emergency contacts, registration information, security questions and app configurations. In total there are 25 storyboards that access, manipulate, and display data in the app. During this app I realized the limitation of MessageUI framework in iOS; instead of silently sending a message, it pops user a dialog and requires user interaction to send. So, I decided to use Twillio calling their RESTful services to send messages.
